## Title:- Iris Species Classification- ML Project
## Dataset link:- http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
### Summary:- 
The iris flowers dataset having only numeric attributes, it is suitable for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms. Beginners can learn about how to load and handle data. It is a small dataset, so it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
The dataset contains 4 attributes- Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length and Sepal Width of 3 species- Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica of Iris flower.
### What is done:- 
The first step performed was to import the necessary libraries and then the dataset was loaded. Then Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was done to highlight the shape, columns, value counts, etc.
For data visualization, Pair plot, scatter plot and Bar plot (Subplot) are used.
The data was split into Training and testing dataset. 
Logistic Regression model, KNeighborsClassifier and Random Forest Models are used for prediction. 
### Conclusion:- 
The accuracy is same for all the 3 models, that is 0.966
